# This is a placeholder for OpenGraph image
# In production, you should replace this with an actual JPG image file (1200x630px)
# This image will be shown when sharing links on social media

# For now, this serves as a reference that the file should exist at this path
# The actual binary JPG file should be placed here before deployment
